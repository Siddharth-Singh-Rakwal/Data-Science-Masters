    "Q1: What is the difference between a t-test and a z-test? Provide an example scenario where you would\n",
    "use each type of test.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. A t-test and a z-test are both statistical tests used to determine whether a sample mean is significantly different from a population mean. The main difference between the two tests is that a t-test is used when the sample size is small (typically less than 30), and the population standard deviation is unknown, while a z-test is used when the sample size is large (typically greater than 30), and the population standard deviation is known or assumed to be known.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose a researcher is interested in determining whether the average height of male students in a particular university is different from the national average height of male students. If the researcher has access to the population standard deviation of male student heights in the country, and the sample size is large (e.g., more than 30 students), the researcher can use a z-test.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, if the researcher does not know the population standard deviation, or the sample size is small (e.g., less than 30 students), the researcher would use a t-test.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another example scenario where a t-test might be used is in a clinical trial to determine whether a new drug is effective in treating a particular condition. In this case, the sample size may be small (e.g., fewer than 30 patients in each treatment group), and the population standard deviation of the response variable (e.g., the level of pain experienced by patients) is typically unknown.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the choice between a t-test and a z-test depends on the characteristics of the data and the research question being addressed."

    "Q2: Differentiate between one-tailed and two-tailed tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. In statistics, a hypothesis test is used to determine whether there is enough evidence to reject or fail to reject a null hypothesis. The null hypothesis is a statement that there is no significant difference between two groups or variables. The alternative hypothesis, on the other hand, is the opposite of the null hypothesis, indicating that there is a significant difference between the two groups or variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "- One-tailed test:\n",
    "\n",
    "A one-tailed test, also known as a directional test, is a statistical test in which the alternative hypothesis specifies the direction of the difference between the two groups or variables. For example, if we want to test whether the mean height of men is greater than that of women, we would use a one-tailed test with the alternative hypothesis: \"The mean height of men is greater than the mean height of women.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In a one-tailed test, the critical region is located entirely on one side of the sampling distribution, and the probability of making a type I error is only in that one tail. The level of significance is usually set at 0.05, and the critical value is determined based on the direction of the alternative hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Two-tailed test:\n",
    "\n",
    "A two-tailed test, also known as a nondirectional test, is a statistical test in which the alternative hypothesis does not specify the direction of the difference between the two groups or variables. For example, if we want to test whether the mean weight of a certain population is different from a specific value, we would use a two-tailed test with the alternative hypothesis: \"The mean weight of the population is different from the specific value.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In a two-tailed test, the critical region is located on both sides of the sampling distribution, and the probability of making a type I error is divided equally between the two tails. The level of significance is usually set at 0.05, and the critical value is determined based on the level of significance and the degrees of freedom.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the main difference between one-tailed and two-tailed tests is that in a one-tailed test, the alternative hypothesis specifies the direction of the difference, while in a two-tailed test, the alternative hypothesis does not specify the direction of the difference."

    "Q3: Explain the concept of Type 1 and Type 2 errors in hypothesis testing. Provide an example scenario for\n",

    "Ans. In hypothesis testing, there are two types of errors that can occur: Type I error and Type II error.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Type I error:\n",
    "\n",
    "Type I error, also known as a false positive, occurs when the null hypothesis is rejected even though it is true. In other words, a Type I error occurs when a researcher concludes that there is a significant effect when, in fact, there is no significant effect. The probability of making a Type I error is denoted by the symbol alpha (α) and is usually set at 0.05 or 0.01.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example scenario: A pharmaceutical company is conducting a clinical trial to test the efficacy of a new drug for a certain disease. The null hypothesis is that the drug has no effect on the disease, and the alternative hypothesis is that the drug is effective in treating the disease. If the researchers conclude that the drug is effective based on the data, but in reality, it has no effect on the disease, this would be a Type I error.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Type II error:\n",
    "\n",
    "Type II error, also known as a false negative, occurs when the null hypothesis is not rejected even though it is false. In other words, a Type II error occurs when a researcher fails to conclude that there is a significant effect when, in fact, there is a significant effect. The probability of making a Type II error is denoted by the symbol beta (β).\n",
    "\n",
    "Example scenario: A car manufacturer is testing the safety of its new car model by conducting crash tests. The null hypothesis is that the new car model is no safer than the old model, and the alternative hypothesis is that the new car model is safer. If the researchers fail to conclude that the new car model is safer based on the data, but in reality, it is safer, this would be a Type II error.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, a Type I error occurs when the null hypothesis is rejected when it is true, and a Type II error occurs when the null hypothesis is not rejected when it is false. Both types of errors can have serious consequences and need to be carefully controlled and minimized in hypothesis testing."

    "Q4: Explain Bayes's theorem with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Bayes's theorem is a fundamental concept in probability theory that describes how to update probabilities based on new information or evidence. It is named after the British statistician Thomas Bayes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The theorem can be stated as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "P(A|B) = P(B|A) x P(A) / P(B)\n",
    "\n",

    "- P(A|B) is the probability of A given B (the posterior probability)\n",
    "- P(B|A) is the probability of B given A (the likelihood)\n",
    "- P(A) is the prior probability of A\n",
    "- P(B) is the prior probability of B\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, Bayes's theorem enables us to calculate the probability of a hypothesis or event based on prior knowledge or assumptions, and new evidence or data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have two boxes, Box A and Box B, each containing two types of fruits: apples and oranges. The proportion of apples and oranges in each box is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Box A: 30% apples and 70% oranges\n",
    "Box B: 70% apples and 30% oranges\n",

    "Q5: What is a confidence interval? How to calculate the confidence interval, explain with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. A confidence interval is a range of values that is likely to contain the true value of a population parameter (such as the mean or proportion) with a certain level of confidence. It is a measure of the precision or uncertainty of an estimate based on a sample of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The confidence interval is calculated by specifying a confidence level (usually 95% or 99%) and using the sample data to estimate the standard error of the sample statistic. The confidence interval is then calculated as the sample statistic plus or minus a margin of error, which is determined by multiplying the standard error by a critical value from the appropriate distribution (usually the t-distribution or z-distribution, depending on the sample size and whether the population standard deviation is known or not).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose we want to estimate the average height of students in a particular school with 95% confidence. We take a random sample of 50 students and measure their heights. The sample mean height is 170 cm, and the sample standard deviation is 5 cm. We can use the t-distribution to calculate the critical value for a 95% confidence interval with 49 degrees of freedom (n-1):\n",

    "SE = s / sqrt(n) = 5 / sqrt(50) = 0.71\n",

    "\n",
    "170 ± 2.009 x 0.71 = (168.40, 171.60)\n",

    "\n",
    "As sample size increases, the margin of error decreases.\n",
