    "Q1: What is Estimation Statistics? Explain point estimate and interval estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. \n",
    "\n",
    "Estimation statistics is a branch of statistics that deals with the process of estimating unknown population parameters using sample data. The purpose of estimation is to use the information gathered from a sample to make inferences about the population from which the sample was drawn.\n",
    "\n",
    "Point estimate refers to the use of a single value to estimate an unknown parameter of a population. For example, if we want to estimate the mean height of a population, we can take a sample of individuals and calculate the mean height of the sample. This calculated mean is then used as a point estimate of the population mean height. Point estimates are often denoted using a hat symbol over the parameter, such as $\\hat{\\mu}$ for the point estimate of the population mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interval estimate, on the other hand, refers to the use of an interval of values to estimate an unknown parameter of a population. For example, if we want to estimate the population mean height, we can use the sample mean height and calculate a confidence interval around it. This confidence interval is then used as an interval estimate of the population mean height. The confidence interval represents a range of values within which we can be confident the true population parameter lies. The level of confidence in the interval estimate is typically specified as a percentage, such as 95% or 99%."

    "Q3: What is Hypothesis testing? Why is it used? State the importance of Hypothesis testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to make decisions about a population parameter based on sample data. It involves the formulation of a null hypothesis and an alternative hypothesis, and the use of sample statistics to test the validity of the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The null hypothesis is a statement that assumes there is no significant difference or relationship between the population parameter and the sample statistic. The alternative hypothesis is a statement that contradicts the null hypothesis and assumes that there is a significant difference or relationship between the population parameter and the sample statistic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hypothesis testing is used to determine whether there is enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis. The process involves selecting an appropriate statistical test, calculating a test statistic and its associated probability (p-value), and comparing the p-value to a pre-determined level of significance (alpha) to determine whether to reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The importance of hypothesis testing lies in its ability to provide a systematic and objective method for making decisions based on sample data. Hypothesis testing allows researchers to test theories and hypotheses, make inferences about populations based on sample data, and draw conclusions that are supported by statistical evidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, hypothesis testing plays a critical role in scientific research and decision-making in various fields such as medicine, economics, psychology, and engineering. It allows researchers and practitioners to make informed decisions based on evidence and helps to avoid errors such as false positives and false negatives that can lead to incorrect conclusions and decisions."

    "Q7: Write down the steps involved in hypothesis testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans. The following are the general steps involved in hypothesis testing:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. State the null and alternative hypotheses: This involves defining the research question and formulating the null hypothesis, which assumes that there is no significant difference or relationship between the population parameter and the sample statistic, and the alternative hypothesis, which contradicts the null hypothesis and assumes that there is a significant difference or relationship.\n",
    "2. Set the level of significance: This involves determining the level of risk that you are willing to take in rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true. The level of significance is usually set at 0.05 or 0.01.\n",
    "3. Collect the data: This involves collecting a sample from the population of interest.\n",
    "4. Calculate the test statistic: This involves using a statistical formula to calculate the test statistic, which is a measure of how different the sample statistic is from the population parameter under the null hypothesis.\n",
    "5. Determine the p-value: This involves calculating the p-value, which is the probability of obtaining a sample statistic as extreme as the observed one, assuming that the null hypothesis is true.\n",
    "6. Make a decision: This involves comparing the p-value with the level of significance and deciding whether to reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "7. Draw a conclusion: This involves interpreting the results and drawing conclusions based on the decision made in step 6. If the null hypothesis is rejected, it means that there is enough evidence to support the alternative hypothesis. If the null hypothesis is not rejected, it means that there is not enough evidence to support the alternative hypothesis."

    "\n",
    "Ans. In hypothesis testing, the p-value is the probability of obtaining a sample statistic as extreme as the observed one, assuming that the null hypothesis is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "The p-value is a crucial component of hypothesis testing as it is used to determine whether to reject or fail to reject the null hypothesis. If the p-value is less than or equal to the level of significance (typically set at 0.05 or 0.01), it indicates that the observed result is unlikely to occur by chance alone and provides evidence against the null hypothesis. In other words, a small p-value suggests that there is enough evidence to support the alternative hypothesis.\n",

    "On the other hand, if the p-value is greater than the level of significance, it suggests that the observed result is likely to occur by chance alone and does not provide enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis. In this case, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the p-value serves as a measure of the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis and guides our decision-making process in hypothesis testing. A smaller p-value suggests stronger evidence against the null hypothesis, whereas a larger p-value suggests weaker evidence against the null hypothesis."

    "Q11: What is Student’s t distribution? When to use the t-Distribution.\n",

    "Ans. Student’s t-distribution is a probability distribution that is used to estimate population parameters when the sample size is small (typically less than 30) or when the population standard deviation is unknown. The distribution is named after William Sealy Gosset, who used the pen name \"Student\" when he published his work on the distribution in 1908.\n",
    "\n",
    "The t-distribution is similar in shape to the standard normal distribution (i.e., bell-shaped and symmetrical), but it has heavier tails, which means that it has more probability in the tails of the distribution than the standard normal distribution. The shape of the t-distribution depends on the sample size and the degrees of freedom, which is equal to the sample size minus one.\n",
    "\n",
    "The t-distribution is used in statistical inference, particularly in hypothesis testing, to compare sample means from two populations or to determine whether a sample mean is significantly different from a hypothesized population mean. It is also used in the construction of confidence intervals for the population mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the sample size is large (typically greater than 30), the t-distribution is approximately the same as the standard normal distribution. Therefore, the t-distribution is typically used when the sample size is small, the population standard deviation is unknown, or when the population distribution is not normal but the sample size is large enough for the central limit theorem to apply."

    "Ans. \n",

    "- n is the sample size\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we want a 95% confidence interval, we can use a significance level of α = 0.05, which gives us a two-tailed test with a critical value of t = 2.009 (from a t-distribution with df = 49).\n",

    "\n",
    "CI = 500 ± 14.16\n",

    "Therefore, the 95% confidence interval for the population mean revenue is $485.84 to $514.16. This means that we are 95% confident that the true population mean revenue falls between these two values based on the sample data."
